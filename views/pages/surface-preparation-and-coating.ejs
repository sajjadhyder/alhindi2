					<p>The internal lining / external painting of pipe work forms a significant part of the work undertaken by IECC Engineers. Whether reclaiming existing corroded pipe work or coating new, we have the experience and facilities to carry out major projects as well as individual pipe spools.</p>
					<p>We also undertake the fabrication and installation of coated pipe work. By collating the various sub-contract activities, we ensure that the configuration and fabrication standards of the pipes will suit the coating process.</p>
					<p>In addition, by carefully selecting the most appropriate lining material and paying special attention to detail such as terminating the lining in flange rebates, we can provide new pipe work with long term corrosion/chemical protection and refurbish badly damaged / corroded pipe work, giving it a renewed service life well in excess of the original installation.</p>
